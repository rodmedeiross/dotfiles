# Git Configuration

Global configuration for `git`

## Installation
Install the config files according to the instructions in this repo's top level README.md

## Using `delta`
This config uses [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for paging, syntax highlighting, and diffing.

Make sure to either install `delta` on your system (try finding "git-delta" in your package manager) or remove all delta-related config from `.gitconfig` if you don't want to use it.
